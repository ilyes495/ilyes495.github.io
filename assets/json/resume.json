      "summary": "• Develop a machine learning-based recalibration model that can accurately predict the cellular binding sites of RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs) given only their intrinsic binding preferences.\n• Reanalyze all available CLIP data to identify biases and experimental artifacts in the dataset. We found evidence that as much as a third of the eCLIP data associated with ENCODE RBPs does not measure direct binding.\n• Investigate various machine learning techniques such as AlphFold, for representing proteins to predict the binding preferences of RNA-binding Proteins (RBPs) from their amino-acid sequences.\n• Analyze large genomic data to understand the role of MSI2-RBP in AML, this include running various bioinformatics pipelines to detect binding sites from HyperTRIBE assay and measure translation efficiency from RiboSTAMP assay.\n• Collaborate with wet-lab teams to address their bioinformatics needs, prepared presentations to communicate the findings and results.\n• Supervise undergraduate interns and graduate rotation students in CLIP-seq data analysis, applying machine learning techniques, and utilizing HPC clusters.\n• Organize regular lab-meeting for a whole year, including scheduling presentations, developing automated scripts to collect and distribute presentation feedback.",
