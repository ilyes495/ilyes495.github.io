PhD Candidate in Computational Biology at Weill Cornell Medicine!

I am a PhD candidate at the [Tri-I Computational Biology and Medicine program](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) at Weill Cornell Medicine and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center supervised by [Quaid Morris](http://www.morrislab.ai/).

I'm interested in the application of machine learning methods to functional genomics, particularly in understanding post-transcriptional regulation. currently working to improve the prediction of cellular binding sites of RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs) by integrting both in-vivo and in-vitro data using a recalibration framework. Also, I am intersted in developing genomic foundation models. Other than that, I collaborate with [Michael Kharas' lab](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/michael-kharas) to understand the role of MSI2-RBP in AML

Previously, I completed my BSc and MSc at Antalya Bilim Unoversity in EEE and CE under the supervision of [Hilal Kazan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vxtfpUQAAAAJ&hl=en).
